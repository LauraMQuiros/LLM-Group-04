To install the peft package, run the following command:
```bash
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft
```

To run the LoRA model you need to be at the root of the repository and run the following command:
```bash
!python src/utils/LoRA.py
```
this has to be done in the terminal, not with IDE default run button, due to the way that paths are built.
